# Top 10 List of Week 01

1. [Virtualization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtualization)<br>
In computing, virtualization refers to the act of creating a virtual (rather than actual) version of something, including virtual computer hardware platforms, storage devices, and computer network resources.

2. [Hypervisor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypervisor)<br>
A hypervisor (or virtual machine monitor, VMM, virtualizer) is computer software, firmware or hardware that creates and runs virtual machines. A computer on which a hypervisor runs one or more virtual machines is called a host machine, and each virtual machine is called a guest machine. The hypervisor presents the guest operating systems with a virtual operating platform and manages the execution of the guest operating systems. Multiple instances of a variety of operating systems may share the virtualized hardware resources: for example, Linux, Windows, and macOS instances can all run on a single physical x86 machine. This contrasts with operating-system-level virtualization, where all instances (usually called containers) must share a single kernel, though the guest operating systems can differ in user space, such as different Linux distributions with the same kernel.

3. [Debian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian)<br>
Debian also known as Debian GNU/Linux, is a Linux distribution composed of free and open-source software, developed by the community-supported Debian Project, which was established by Ian Murdock on August 16, 1993. The first version of Debian (0.01) was released on September 15, 1993,and its first stable version (1.1) was released on June 17, 1996.The Debian Stable branch is the most popular edition for personal computers and servers. Debian is also the basis for many other distributions, most notably Ubuntu.

4. [Virtual Memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_memory)<br>
In computing, virtual memory (also virtual storage) is a memory management technique that provides an "idealized abstraction of the storage resources that are actually available on a given machine" which "creates the illusion to users of a very large (main) memory".

5. [Regex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression)<br>
A regular expression (shortened as regex or regexp; also referred to as rational expression) is a sequence of characters that define a search pattern. Usually such patterns are used by string-searching algorithms for "find" or "find and replace" operations on strings, or for input validation. It is a technique developed in theoretical computer science and formal language theory.

6. [Cloud Computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing)<br>
Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage (cloud storage) and computing power, without direct active management by the user. The term is generally used to describe data centers available to many users over the Internet. Large clouds, predominant today, often have functions distributed over multiple locations from central servers. If the connection to the user is relatively close, it may be designated an edge server.

7. [System Call](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-system-call/)<br>
In computing, a system call is the programmatic way in which a computer program requests a service from the kernel of the operating system it is executed on. A system call is a way for programs to interact with the operating system. A computer program makes a system call when it makes a request to the operating system’s kernel. System call provides the services of the operating system to the user programs via Application Program Interface(API).

8. [Cloud Service](https://www.citrix.com/glossary/what-is-a-cloud-service.html)<br>
A scripting or script language is a programming language for a special run-time environment that automates the execution of tasks; the tasks could alternatively be executed one-by-one by a human operator. Scripting languages are often interpreted, rather than compiled.

9. [Type of Virtualization](https://www.kelsercorp.com/blog/the-7-types-of-virtualization)<br>
The 7 Types of Virtualization: OS Virtualization—aka Virtual Machines, Application-Server Virtualization, Application Virtualization, Administrative Virtualization, Network Virtualization, Hardware Virtualization, & Storage Virtualization

10. [Virtualization vs Emulation](https://www.hitechnectar.com/blogs/virtualization-emulation/#:~:text=The%20Main%20Difference%20Between%20Virtualization%20and%20Emulation&text=The%20main%20difference%20between%20the,of%20domains%20in%20use%20language.&text=Whereas%2C%20in%20an%20emulator%2C%20the,run%20on%20the%20physical%20hardware.)<br>
There are several differents between virtualization and emulation
