# Top 10 List of Week 06

1. [Handling Concurrency with States](https://flylib.com/books/en/2.100.1.104/1/)<br>
Some of your objects can (in effect) walk and chew gum at the same time. Think of the objects you have that are aggregations: They include the whole object (the aggregate), and all the individual part objects contained within the whole. The parts of your aggregate work independently of each other, a situation called concurrency. So you need a way to show that some states in your objects are concurrent—they don’t depend on each other, and can (but don’t have to) happen at the same time. Remember that concurrent objects have causally independent behavior; in object-oriented systems, concurrent doesn’t mean “simultaneous.” Concurrent independent behavior among concurrent objects can be simultaneous—but it doesn’t have to be.

2. [Role of Interrupts](http://faculty.salina.k-state.edu/tim/ossg/Introduction/OSworking.html)<br> 
Interrupts are signals sent to the CPU by external devices, normally I/O devices. They tell the CPU to stop its current activities and execute the appropriate part of the operating system.

3. [Atomic Object](https://spin.atomicobject.com/2016/01/06/defining-atomic-object/)<br> 
In computer programming, an operation done by a computer is considered atomic if it is guaranteed to be isolated from other operations that may be happening at the same time. Put another way, atomic operations are indivisible. Atomic operations are critically important when dealing with shared resources.

4. [Synchronization Primitives](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8017507/definition-of-synchronization-primitive)<br>
Synchronization primitives are simple software mechanisms provided by a platform (e.g. operating system) to its users for the purposes of supporting thread or process synchronization. They're usually built using lower level mechanisms (e.g. atomic operations, memory barriers, spinlocks, context switches etc).

5. [Process Control Block(PCB)](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/what-is-process-control-block-pcb)<br> 
Process Control Block is a data structure that contains information of the process related to it. The process control block is also known as a task control block, entry of the process table, etc. It is very important for process management as the data structuring for processes is done in terms of the PCB. It also defines the current state of the operating system.

6. [Process Identifier(PID)](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/p/pid.htm)<br> 
PID is a unique number that identifies each running processes in an operating system, such as Linux, Unix, macOS, and Microsoft Windows. The output below shows a few of the processes running in Windows and their associated PIDs listed in the PID column.

7. [Process Creation](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/process-creation-vs-process-termination-in-operating-system)<br> 
A process may be created in the system for different operations. Some of the events that lead to process creation are as follows: User request for process creation, System Initialization, Batch job initialization, and Execution of a process creation system call by a running process.

8. [Process Termination](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/process-creation-vs-process-termination-in-operating-system)<br>
Process termination occurs when the process is terminated The exit() system call is used by most operating systems for process termination.

9. [Inter Process Communication (IPC)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/inter-process-communication-ipc/)<br> 
Inter process communication (IPC) is a mechanism which allows processes to communicate with each other and synchronize their actions. The communication between these processes can be seen as a method of co-operation between them. Processes can communicate with each other through both: Shared Memory and Message passing

10. [Thread](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/thread-in-operating-system/)<br>
A thread is a path of execution within a process. A process can contain multiple threads.
