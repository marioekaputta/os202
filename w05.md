# Top 10 List of Week 05
1. [Virtual Memory: Separation Logical from Physical](http://denninginstitute.com/modules/vm/green/defn.html)<br>Virtual memory is a technique that allows processes that may not be entirely in the memory to execute by means of automatic storage allocation upon request. The term virtual memory refers to the abstraction of separating LOGICAL memory--memory as seen by the process--from PHYSICAL memory--memory as seen by the processor. Because of this separation, the programmer needs to be aware of only the logical memory space while the operating system maintains two or more levels of physical memory space. 
2. [Page Replacement Algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/page-replacement-algorithms-in-operating-systems/)<br> In an operating system that uses paging for memory management, a page replacement algorithm is needed to decide which page needs to be replaced when new page comes in.
3. [First-In-First-Out (FIFO)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-page-replacement-algorithms-set-2-fifo/)<br> This is the simplest page replacement algorithm. In this algorithm, operating system keeps track of all pages in the memory in a queue, oldest page is in the front of the queue. When a page needs to be replaced page in the front of the queue is selected for removal. 
4. [Least Recently Used (LRU)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-for-least-recently-used-lru-page-replacement-algorithm/)<br> In Least Recently Used (LRU) algorithm is a Greedy algorithm where the page to be replaced is least recently used. The idea is based on locality of reference, the least recently used page is not likely
5. [Optimal Algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/optimal-page-replacement-algorithm/)<br> In this algorithm, OS replaces the page that will not be used for the longest period of time in future. 
6. [Page Fault](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/page-replacement-algorithms-in-operating-systems/)<br> A page fault happens when a running program accesses a memory page that is mapped into the virtual address space, but not loaded in physical memory.
7. [Belady Anomaly](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/beladys-anomaly-in-page-replacement-algorithms/)<br> Bélády’s anomaly is the name given to the phenomenon where increasing the number of page frames results in an increase in the number of page faults for a given memory access pattern. 
8. [Frame Allocation Algorithms](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/operating-system-allocation-frames/)<br>The two algorithms commonly used to allocate frames to a process are: Equal allocation and Proportional allocation
9. [Demand Paging](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/virtual-memory-in-operating-system/)<br> The process of loading the page into memory on demand (whenever page fault occurs) is known as demand paging. 
10. [Thrashing](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/techniques-to-handle-thrashing/)<br>Thrashing is a condition or a situation when the system is spending a major portion of its time in servicing the page faults, but the actual processing done is very negligible.
