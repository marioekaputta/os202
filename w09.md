# Top 10 List of Week 09

1. [Storage Management](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/storage-management/)<br>
Storage Management is defined as it refers to the management of the data storage equipment’s that are used to store the user/computer generated data. Hence it is a tool or set of processes used by an administrator to keep your data and storage equipment’s safe.

2. [Boot Block](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/boot-block-in-operating-system/)<br> 
Basically for a computer to start running to get an instance when it is powered up or rebooted it need to have an initial program to run. And this initial program which is known as bootstrap need to be simple. It must initialize all aspects of the system, from CPU registers to device controllers and the contents of the main memory and then starts the operating system. 

3. [RAID](https://searchstorage.techtarget.com/definition/RAID)<br> 
RAID (redundant array of independent disks) is a way of storing the same data in different places on multiple hard disks or solid-state drives to protect data in the case of a drive failure. There are different RAID levels, however, and not all have the goal of providing redundancy.

4. [UEFI(Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) and how is it different from BIOS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/uefiunified-extensible-firmware-interface-and-how-is-it-different-from-bios/)<br>
The Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI), like BIOS (Basic Input Output System) is a firmware that runs when the computer is booted. It initializes the hardware and loads the operating system into the memory. However, being the more modern solution and overcoming various limitations of BIOS, UEFI is all set to replace the former.

5. [ACPI: Advanced Configuration and Power Interface](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/acpi-full-form/)<br> 
ACPI stands for Advanced Configuration and Power Interface . As the name suggests, ACPI is responsible for the management of power in our computer system. This specification was introduced by Microsoft, Intel, and Toshiba. It helps the operating system to control the amount of power that is being given to other computer devices when they are not in use such as cd players, printers, etc.

6. [POST: Power-On Self-Test](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-postpower-on-self-test/)<br> 
A power-on self-test (POST) is a set of routines performed by firmware or software immediately after a computer is powered on, to determine if the hardware is working as expected. The process would proceed further only if the required hardware is working correctly, else the BIOS(Basic Input Output Software) would issue an error message.

7. [Boot Loader](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/3324/boot-loader)<br> 
A boot loader is a type of program that loads and starts the boot time tasks and processes of an operating system or the computer system. It enables loading the operating system within the computer memory when a computer is started or booted up.

8. [Basic Input Output System (BIOS)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-basic-input-output-system-bios/)<br>
It provides a set of instructions and is responsible for booting the computer. The BIOS performs all the test needed at startup time. These tests are collectively known as Power On Self Test(POST) .The computer contains hardware like keyboard, monitor, disk drives, etc. there functioning requires interfacing with the operating system. The BIOS provides drivers for basic hardware like keyboard and monitor, mouse, etc. The operating system provides hardware for printer, modem, etc. Drivers for some hardware may not be available in the operating system hence these have to be explicitly installed by the user.

9. [GRUB: GRand Unified Boot system](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/concept-behind-multiple-booting-guide/)<br> 
(GRand Unified Bootloader) A program that calls a Unix/Linux operating system into memory. Officially GNU GRUB, GRUB is a popular boot loader due to its flexibility and configuration capabilities, allowing changes to be made at boot time and support for boot images from the network. See GNU and boot loader.

10. [systemd](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/systemctl-in-unix/)<br>
systemd is system and service manager for Unix like operating systems(most of the distributions, not all). As the system boots up, the first process created, i.e. init process with PID = 1, is systemd system that initiates the userspace services.
