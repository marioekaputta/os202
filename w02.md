# Top 10 List of Week 02

1. [Protecting](https://choosetoencrypt.com/privacy/complete-beginners-guide-to-internet-safety-privacy/)<br>
Who Are You Protecting Yourself From? Governments, ISPs,  (H)Crackers, Trackers, & Advertisers/Malwertisers

2. [Privacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy)<br>
Privacy is the ability of an individual or group to seclude themselves or information about themselves, and thereby express themselves selectively.

3. [Security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security)<br>
Security is freedom from, or resilience against, potential harm (or other unwanted coercive change) caused by others. Beneficiaries (technically referents) of security may be of persons and social groups, objects and institutions, ecosystems or any other entity or phenomenon vulnerable to unwanted change.

4. [Social Engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_engineering_(security))<br>
In the context of information security, social engineering is the psychological manipulation of people into performing actions or divulging confidential information. This differs from social engineering within the social sciences, which does not concern the divulging of confidential information. A type of confidence trick for the purpose of information gathering, fraud, or system access, it differs from a traditional "con" in that it is often one of many steps in a more complex fraud scheme.

5. [Threat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threat_(computer))<br>
In computer security, a threat is a potential negative action or event facilitated by a vulnerability that results in an unwanted impact to a computer system or application.

A threat can be either a negative "intentional" event (i.e. hacking: an individual cracker or a criminal organization) or an "accidental" negative event (e.g. the possibility of a computer malfunctioning, or the possibility of a natural disaster event such as an earthquake, a fire, or a tornado) or otherwise a circumstance, capability, action, or event.

6. [Security Violation Methods](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~jbell/CourseNotes/OperatingSystems/15_Security.html)<br>
Security Violation Methods: Masquerading, Replay attack, Human-in-the-middle attack, Session hijacking, Privilege escalation. More about that is on the link.

7. [Security Measure Levels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_level)<br>
In cryptography, security level is a measure of the strength that a cryptographic primitive — such as a cipher or hash function — achieves. Security level is usually expressed in "bits", where n-bit security means that the attacker would have to perform 2n operations to break it, but other methods have been proposed that more closely model the costs for an attacker. This allows for convenient comparison between algorithms and is useful when combining multiple primitives in a hybrid cryptosystem, so there is no clear weakest link. For example, AES-128 (key size 128 bits) is designed to offer a 128-bit security level, which is considered roughly equivalent to 3072-bit RSA.

8. [Linux Security](https://www.computerworld.com/article/3252823/why-linux-is-better-than-windows-or-macos-for-security.html)<br>
Joe Moore said, "Linux has the potential to be the most secure, but requires the user be something of a power user."

9. [Implementing Security Defenses](https://www.information-age.com/implement-secure-defence-hackers-123461974/)<br>
Implementing Security Defenses: Policy, Assesment, Prevention, Detection, Protection, Auditing.

10. [Cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography)<br>
Cryptography is the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of third parties called adversaries. More generally, cryptography is about constructing and analyzing protocols that prevent third parties or the public from reading private messages; various aspects in information security such as data confidentiality, data integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation are central to modern cryptography. Modern cryptography exists at the intersection of the disciplines of mathematics, computer science, electrical engineering, communication science, and physics. Applications of cryptography include electronic commerce, chip-based payment cards, digital currencies, computer passwords, and military communications.
