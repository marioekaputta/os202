# Top 10 List of Week 04

1. [Paging](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/paging-in-operating-system/)<br>
Paging is a memory management scheme that eliminates the need for contiguous allocation of physical memory. This scheme permits the physical address space of a process to be non – contiguous.

2. [Logical Address](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/logical-and-physical-address-in-operating-system/)<br>
Logical Address is generated by CPU while a program is running. The logical address is virtual address as it does not exist physically, therefore, it is also known as Virtual Address. This address is used as a reference to access the physical memory location by CPU. The term Logical Address Space is used for the set of all logical addresses generated by a program’s perspective.
The hardware device called Memory-Management Unit is used for mapping logical address to its corresponding physical address. 

3. [Physical Address](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/logical-and-physical-address-in-operating-system/)<br> 
Physical Address identifies a physical location of required data in a memory. The user never directly deals with the physical address but can access by its corresponding logical address. The user program generates the logical address and thinks that the program is running in this logical address but the program needs physical memory for its execution, therefore, the logical address must be mapped to the physical address by MMU before they are used. The term Physical Address Space is used for all physical addresses corresponding to the logical addresses in a Logical address space.

4. [Address Translation](https://www.d.umn.edu/~gshute/os/address-translation.xhtml)<br>
In a system with virtual memory the main memory can be viewed as a cache for the disk, which serves as the lower-level store. Due to the enormous difference between memory access times and disk access times, a fully-associative caching scheme is used. That is, the entire main memory is a single set - any page can be placed anywhere in main memory. This makes the set field of the address vanish. All that remains is a tag and an offset 

5. [Page Table](https://www.javatpoint.com/os-page-table)<br>
Page Table is a data structure used by the virtual memory system to store the mapping between logical addresses and physical addresses. 

6. [Shared Libraries in Linux](https://www.tecmint.com/understanding-shared-libraries-in-linux/)<br>
In programming, a library is an assortment of pre-compiled pieces of code that can be reused in a program. Libraries simplify life for programmers, in that they provide reusable functions, routines, classes, data structures and so on (written by a another programmer), which they can use in their programs.For instance, if you are building an application that needs to perform math operations, you don’t have to create a new math function for that, you can simply use existing functions in libraries for that programming language. 

7. [Static Libraries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_library)<br>
In computer science, a static library or statically-linked library is a set of routines, external functions and variables which are resolved in a caller at compile-time and copied into a target application by a compiler, linker, or binder, producing an object file and a stand-alone executable. 

8. [Pointer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointer_(computer_programming))<br>
In computer science, a pointer is an object in many programming languages that stores a memory address. This can be that of another value located in computer memory, or in some cases, that of memory-mapped computer hardware. A pointer references a location in memory, and obtaining the value stored at that location is known as dereferencing the pointer. As an analogy, a page number in a book's index could be considered a pointer to the corresponding page; dereferencing such a pointer would be done by flipping to the page with the given page number and reading the text found on that page. The actual format and content of a pointer variable is dependent on the underlying computer architecture.

9. [Address Binding](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mapping-virtual-addresses-to-physical-addresses/)<br>
Address binding is the process of mapping from one address space to another address space. Logical address is address generated by CPU during execution whereas Physical Address refers to location in memory unit(the one that is loaded into memory). 

10. [Fragmentation](https://prepinsta.com/operating-systems/fragmentation/)<br>
Memory space in the system constantly goes through loading and releasing processes and their resources because of which the total memory spaces gets broken into a lot of small pieces, this causes creation small non utilised fragmented memory spaces, which are so small that normal processes can not fit into those small fragments, causing those memory spaces not getting utilised at all, this is called memory Fragmentation in operating system.
