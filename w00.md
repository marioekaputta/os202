# Top 10 List of Week 00

1. [Operating System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system)<br>
An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware, software resources, and provides common services for computer programs.

2. [APIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Programmable_Interrupt_Controller)<br>
In computing, Intel's Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller (APIC) is a family of interrupt controllers. As its name suggests, the APIC is more advanced than Intel's 8259 Programmable Interrupt Controller (PIC), particularly enabling the construction of multiprocessor systems. It is one of several architectural designs intended to solve interrupt routing efficiency issues in multiprocessor computer systems.

3. [Interupt Handling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrupt)<br>
In digital computers, an interrupt is a response by the processor to an event that needs attention from the software. An interrupt condition alerts the processor and serves as a request for the processor to interrupt the currently executing code when permitted, so that the event can be processed in a timely manner. If the request is accepted, the processor responds by suspending its current activities, saving its state, and executing a function called an interrupt handler (or an interrupt service routine, ISR) to deal with the event. This interruption is temporary, and, unless the interrupt indicates a fatal error, the processor resumes normal activities after the interrupt handler finishes.

4. [The von Neumann Model.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_architecture)<br>
The von Neumann architecture—also known as the von Neumann model or Princeton architecture—is a computer architecture based on a 1945 description by John von Neumann and others in the First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC.[1] That document describes a design architecture for an electronic digital computer with these components:

A processing unit that contains an arithmetic logic unit and processor registers
A control unit that contains an instruction register and program counter
Memory that stores data and instructions
External mass storage
Input and output mechanisms

5. [Block Diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_diagram)<br>
A block diagram is a diagram of a system in which the principal parts or functions are represented by blocks connected by lines that show the relationships of the blocks. They are heavily used in engineering in hardware design, electronic design, software design, and process flow diagrams.

6. [Direct Memory Access (DMA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_memory_access)<br>
Direct memory access (DMA) is a feature of computer systems that allows certain hardware subsystems to access main system memory (random-access memory) independent of the central processing unit (CPU).

7. [Kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(operating_system))<br>
The kernel is a computer program at the core of a computer's operating system with complete control over everything in the system. It is an integral part of any operating system. It is the "portion of the operating system code that is always resident in memory". It facilitates interactions between hardware and software components. On most systems, it is one of the first programs loaded on startup (after the bootloader. It handles the rest of startup as well as input/output (I/O) requests from software, translating them into data-processing instructions for the central processing unit. It handles memory and peripherals like keyboards, monitors, printers, and speakers.

8. [API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API)<br>
An application programming interface (API) is a computing interface which defines interactions between multiple software intermediaries. It defines the kinds of calls or requests that can be made, how to make them, the data formats that should be used, the conventions to follow, etc. It can also provide extension mechanisms so that users can extend existing functionality in various ways and to varying degrees.

9. [Cache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_(computing))<br>
In computing, a cache  is a hardware or software component that stores data so that future requests for that data can be served faster; the data stored in a cache might be the result of an earlier computation or a copy of data stored elsewhere. A cache hit occurs when the requested data can be found in a cache, while a cache miss occurs when it cannot. Cache hits are served by reading data from the cache, which is faster than recomputing a result or reading from a slower data store; thus, the more requests that can be served from the cache, the faster the system performs.

10. [Data Buffer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_buffer)<br>
In computer science, a data buffer (or just buffer) is a region of a physical memory storage used to temporarily store data while it is being moved from one place to another. Typically, the data is stored in a buffer as it is retrieved from an input device (such as a microphone) or just before it is sent to an output device (such as speakers). However, a buffer may be used when moving data between processes within a computer. This is comparable to buffers in telecommunication. Buffers can be implemented in a fixed memory location in hardware—or by using a virtual data buffer in software, pointing at a location in the physical memory.
