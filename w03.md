# Top 10 List of Week 03

1. [Metadata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata)<br>
Metadata is "data that provides information about other data". In other words, it is "data about data". Many distinct types of metadata exist, including descriptive metadata, structural metadata, administrative metadata, reference metadata and statistical metadata.

2. [File System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_system)<br>
In computing, a file system or filesystem (often abbreviated to fs) controls how data is stored and retrieved. Without a file system, data placed in a storage medium would be one large body of data with no way to tell where one piece of data stops and the next begins.

3. [Directories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directory_(computing))<br>
In computing, a directory is a file system cataloging structure which contains references to other computer files, and possibly other directories. On many computers, directories are known as folders, or drawers, analogous to a workbench or the traditional office filing cabinet.

4. [Disk Particioning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_partitioning)<br>
Disk partitioning or disk slicing is the creation of one or more regions on secondary storage, so that each region can be managed separately.These regions are called partitions. It is typically the first step of preparing a newly installed disk, before any file system is created

5. [Memory Mapped Files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory-mapped_file)<br>
A memory-mapped file is a segment of virtual memory that has been assigned a direct byte-for-byte correlation with some portion of a file or file-like resource. This resource is typically a file that is physically present on disk, but can also be a device, shared memory object, or other resource that the operating system can reference through a file descriptor. Once present, this correlation between the file and the memory space permits applications to treat the mapped portion as if it were primary memory.

6. [Special Purpose File Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Free_special-purpose_file_systems)<br>
There are 30 file systems. Explore more from the link

7. [File Naming](https://libguides.princeton.edu/c.php?g=102546&p=930626)<br>
Files should be named consistently, File names should be short but descriptive (<25 characters) (Briney), Avoid special characters or spaces in a file name, Use capitals and underscores instead of periods or spaces or slashes, Use date format ISO 8601: YYYYMMDD, Include a version number (Creamer et al.), and Write down naming convention in data management plan

8. [Journaling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journaling_file_system)<br>
A journaling file system is a file system that keeps track of changes not yet committed to the file system's main part by recording the intentions of such changes in a data structure known as a "journal", which is usually a circular log. In the event of a system crash or power failure, such file systems can be brought back online more quickly with a lower likelihood of becoming corrupted.

9. [Virtual File Sytems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_file_system)<br>
A virtual file system (VFS) or virtual filesystem switch is an abstract layer on top of a more concrete file system. The purpose of a VFS is to allow client applications to access different types of concrete file systems in a uniform way.

10. [Remote File Systems](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/ifs/introduction-to-remote-file-systems)<br>
Remote file systems enable an application that runs on a client computer to access files stored on a different computer. Remote file systems also often make other resources (remote printers, for example) accessible from a client computer. The remote file and resource access takes place using some form of local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN), point-to-point link, or other communication mechanism. These file systems are often referred as network file systems or distributed file systems.
