# Top 10 List of Week 07

1. [Race Condition](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34510/what-is-a-race-condition)<br>
A race condition occurs when two or more threads can access shared data and they try to change it at the same time. Because the thread scheduling algorithm can swap between threads at any time, you don't know the order in which the threads will attempt to access the shared data.

2. [Critical Section Problem](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/critical-section-problem)<br> 
The critical section is a code segment where the shared variables can be accessed. An atomic action is required in a critical section i.e. only one process can execute in its critical section at a time. All the other processes have to wait to execute in their critical sections.

3. [Peterson's Solution](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/peterson-s-problem)<br> 
Peterson’s solution provides a good algorithmic description of solving the critical-section problem and illustrates some of the complexities involved in designing software that addresses the requirements of mutual exclusion, progress, and bounded waiting.

4. [Semaphore](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/semaphores-in-operating-system)<br>
Semaphores are integer variables that are used to solve the critical section problem by using two atomic operations, wait and signal that are used for process synchronization.

5. [Bounded Buffer Problem](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/bounded-buffer)<br> 
Bounded buffer problem, which is also called producer consumer problem, is one of the classic problems of synchronization. Let's start by understanding the problem here, before moving on to the solution and program code.

6. [Readers-Writers Problem](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/readers-writers-problem)<br> 
The readers-writers problem relates to an object such as a file that is shared between multiple processes. Some of these processes are readers i.e. they only want to read the data from the object and some of the processes are writers i.e. they want to write into the object.

7. [Dining-Philosopers Problem](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/dining-philosophers-problem-dpp)<br> 
The dining philosophers problem states that there are 5 philosophers sharing a circular table and they eat and think alternatively. There is a bowl of rice for each of the philosophers and 5 chopsticks. A philosopher needs both their right and left chopstick to eat. A hungry philosopher may only eat if there are both chopsticks available.Otherwise a philosopher puts down their chopstick and begin thinking again.

8. [Deadlock](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/process-deadlocks-in-operating-system)<br>
A deadlock happens in operating system when two or more processes need some resource to complete their execution that is held by the other process.

9. [Starvation vs Deadlock](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-deadlock-and-starvation-in-os/)<br> 
Starvation is the problem that occurs when high priority processes keep executing and low priority processes get blocked for indefinite time. In heavily loaded computer system, a steady stream of higher-priority processes can prevent a low-priority process from ever getting the CPU. In starvation resources are continuously utilized by high priority processes. Problem of starvation can be resolved using Aging. In Aging priority of long waiting processes is gradually increased.

10. [Banker's Algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bankers-algorithm-in-operating-system-2/)<br>
The banker’s algorithm is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm that tests for safety by simulating the allocation for predetermined maximum possible amounts of all resources, then makes an “s-state” check to test for possible activities, before deciding whether allocation should be allowed to continue.
